/**
 * A ScrollViewComponent enables a group of entities to behave like a masked scrolling area, with
 * optional horizontal and vertical scroll bars.
 * @property {boolean} horizontal Whether to enable horizontal scrolling.
 * @property {boolean} vertical Whether to enable vertical scrolling.
 * @property {number} scrollMode Specifies how the scroll view should behave when the user scrolls
 * past the end of the content. Modes are defined as follows:
 *
 * - {@link SCROLL_MODE_CLAMP}: Content does not scroll any further than its bounds.
 * - {@link SCROLL_MODE_BOUNCE}: Content scrolls past its bounds and then gently bounces back.
 * - {@link SCROLL_MODE_INFINITE}: Content can scroll forever.
 * @property {number} bounceAmount Controls how far the content should move before bouncing back.
 * @property {number} friction Controls how freely the content should move if thrown, i.e. By
 * flicking on a phone or by flinging the scroll wheel on a mouse. A value of 1 means that content
 * will stop immediately; 0 means that content will continue moving forever (or until the bounds of
 * the content are reached, depending on the scrollMode).
 * @property {boolean} useMouseWheel Whether to use mouse wheel for scrolling (horizontally and
 * vertically).
 * @property {Vec2} mouseWheelSensitivity Mouse wheel horizontal and vertical sensitivity. Only
 * used if useMouseWheel is set. Setting a direction to 0 will disable mouse wheel scrolling in
 * that direction. 1 is a default sensitivity that is considered to feel good. The values can be
 * set higher or lower than 1 to tune the sensitivity. Defaults to [1, 1].
 * @property {number} horizontalScrollbarVisibility Controls whether the horizontal scrollbar
 * should be visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the
 * viewport.
 * @property {number} verticalScrollbarVisibility Controls whether the vertical scrollbar should be
 * visible all the time, or only visible when the content exceeds the size of the viewport.
 * @property {import('../../entity.js').Entity} viewportEntity The entity to be used as the masked
 * viewport area, within which the content will scroll. This entity must have an ElementGroup
 * component.
 * @property {import('../../entity.js').Entity} contentEntity The entity which contains the
 * scrolling content itself. This entity must have an Element component.
 * @property {import('../../entity.js').Entity} horizontalScrollbarEntity The entity to be used as
 * the vertical scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component.
 * @property {import('../../entity.js').Entity} verticalScrollbarEntity The entity to be used as
 * the vertical scrollbar. This entity must have a Scrollbar component.
